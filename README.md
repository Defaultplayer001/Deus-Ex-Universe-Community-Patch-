# Deus-Ex-Unofficial-Patch-

This is an unofficial Patch Package assembled by Xen's Deus Ex Archive: https://www.reddit.com/r/dxarchive/
It includes every patch available, alternate exes/renderers as well as every translation we know of.

Also included is a program (Antimicro) that will run automatically when you launch the shortcut. This will let you use any gamepad using the Xbox 360 driver in the game!
Keybinds and guide can be found in the Help folder!

Also included are the original demo files which you can install with multiplayer patch.
This let's you play the full multiplayer and singleplayer up to the end of mission 2!

Changelog
-XP Compatability (removed all commands not present in XP, older Deus Exe included in files)

To do
-Huren,Biomod,Shifter, Shifter+, Vanilla Matters install options
-Look into having a seperate GMDX and Revision demo installer (very unlikely to be possible for either)
-HDTPAway would help with this, look into the source more
-Organize every mod/patch into it's own folder
-Include XP setup flag (press X at the start to set)
-Ini tweaks (Keybinds, masterserver, openAL additions,Language)
-Rewrite to output all installs to INSTALL directory, then move to root. This will let people rewrite easily.
-Include option to use Kentie's by default(include warning about ini's by Bjorn) 
-Press O for options  
-Set Japanese to install last(due to unique translation method)
-Look into a method to let user change install defaults (Ex, have XP, French, and Kenties install options run unattended by remembering previous install options)
-FIx Laguardia loading point, LP's in general to be in line with design doc
-Fix Lucky Money LP
-FIx Ship Fan LP
-Fix Inv addition bug on starting a new game after death, not present in the original demo release, investigate and copy.
-Make a big package with new vision,  HDTP, ENB, and if you can GMDX/Revision. Don't exceed three packages. Big\Medium\Small, ideally two.
-Setup Anti-micro, set to laucn with regular shortcut
-Add ps2 training dialogue, which is non-keybind specific. (available pre-extracted and converted under Media\Music\Deus Ex Complete Soundtrack, OST, and Sound Effects Collection\Sound Effects and Conversations in the archive). Flag and branch off, DON'T replace. Negligable file size, maintains legacy, someone might want it.
-Fix long tunnel in nyc to nsfhq, in the rescue paul mission
-Fix Elevator in Jocks, breaks if you jump to maggies, and one player goes down. It can't be called up. Only relevant for HX
-FIx unatco isn't perfect line if it hasn't been
-Make a list of all goals that should be inactive, repeat it at least at every goal given.This should enable HX sequence breaking to be a bit neater. 
-Add HX to public package by default as soon as Han let's people distribute it.
-Add FemJC playermodel option and convo flag, ideally an option that lets the user load any skin/model, ask bogie for help
-Add Bogie HX by default, why not, small af
-Eventually need to abandon previous work, implement a more modloader like functionality, load specfic files instead of transfering them. This is to enable the whole archive to be loaded.
-Press O for one for all, change options to choices, quicker to press anyways
-Experiment with the various modloaders(also kenties) and custom directorys in the ini file
-Include documention on console commands?
-Include controller documentation!
-Include PS2 Theme as an option
-Stop here for now Jesus Christ Denton
-Feature creep up the wazoo
-This was supposed to be done in like a day
-Maybe set knowmaggie=true if you meet the redtriad01 https://i.imgur.com/JqpQ7tP.png
-Make a list of needed localization(int) files
-switch to setup manifest not patch
-for confix translations remember to DELET/COPY AUDIO
-check ambrosia code for 747 and boathouse, specifically what happens if you check the boathouse last. looks like it says one barrel is left

https://www.gog.com/forum/deus_ex_series/deus_ex_for_linux/page2
https://www.gog.com/forum/deus_ex_series/how_to_play_deus_ex_on_a_mac
-figure out updated files

-5/25
-Rero

Controller
-Add ps2 Tutorial convo
-Input tweak, let rmb advance convos, ect
-Optional un-asterisk code entry option, and a clear function
