<FONT color="#0000FF"  face="Arial"><B><a name="installation">Installation</a><br></B></FONT>
Installing <I>Deus Ex </I>is simple. Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive. After a few seconds, the <B>Install Program </B>starts.  Click on the <B>Next</B> button and follow the on-screen prompts.<br>
 <br>
 In the event the Launch Panel does <U>not</U> appear when you insert the CD:<br>
 <br>
 Double-click on the <B>MY COMPUTER</B> icon, then double-click on the <B>CD-ROM</B> icon and, lastly, double-click on the <B> SETUP.EXE</B> file<br>
 <br>
 Or:<br>
 <br>
 Click on the <B>START</B> button. Choose <B>Run</B> from the ensuing pop-up menu. Type <B>d:\setup</B> in the box provided (where &quot;d:&quot;  designates your CD-ROM drive letter). Click on the OK button to begin the install program.<br>
 <br>
 The first thing you see when you run the setup program is a license agreement. Read this and click &quot;Next&quot; to continue.<br>
 <br>
 You are then given the opportunity to change the install path and directory to which you wish to install the game on your hard  drive. The default is <B>C:\DeusEx</B>.<br>
 <br>
 You have several options with regard to install size.  For the best performance, we recommend that you install <B>all</B> of the game components to your hard drive.  However, to save hard drive space, you may choose not to install certain components. To do this, click  the check marks next to each component you do not wish to install to unselect them. <br>
 <br>
 One of the optional components is DirectX. Make sure you install this unless you are absolutely sure you have already  installed DirectX 7.0a on your machine.<br>
 <br>
 If you choose to install DirectX 7.0a on your machine, the <B>Microsoft DirectX 7</B> install routine will run at the end of the  installation process. DirectX 7.0a must be installed on your system for <I>Deus Ex</I> to run successfully.   If DirectX is installed,  you will need to reboot your computer before playing <I>Deus Ex</I>.<br>
 <br>

 <FONT color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><B><a name="video"></a>Video Configuration</B></font> <br>
 The first time the game is run, the <B>Deus Ex Video Configuration</B> screen appears. This screen also appears if you decide to  change the <B>rendering device</B> from within the game. <br>
 <br>
 <B>To run Deus Ex you must have a 3D accelerator card installed.</B> We officially support the following two video drivers:<br>
 <br>
 	<B>3Dfx Glide for Windows<br>
 	Direct3D Support<br>
 <br>
 </B>If you wish to run the game on a 3Dfx-based card, select <B>3Dfx Glide for Windows</B>.  For all other 3D cards, select <B> Direct3D Support</B>.  If you decide to run in any of the other graphic modes, the game may run very slowly or may not run at  all.  <br>
 <br>
 <B>If you experience any problems running Deus Ex, please update your graphic card drivers.  </B><I>Deus Ex</I> was tested with the latest graphic card drivers available.<br>
 <br>
 These graphic modes are available but are <B>not supported</B>:<br>
 <br>
 	<B>Software Rendering<br>
 	OpenGL<br>
 	S3 Metal</B><br>
 <br>
 We do not recommend running the game in any non-supported modes.<br>

 <br>
 To begin playing <I>Deus Ex</I>, insert the <I>Deus Ex</I> CD into the CD-ROM drive. After a few seconds, the Launch panel should  appear on the screen via the AutoPlay feature. Click on the <B>Play</B> button to start the game.  <br>
 <br>
 In the event the AutoPlay feature does not work, click on the <B>My Computer</B> icon and then click on the <FONT size="3"><B>CD-ROM</B> </FONT><FONT size="3">icon to  bring up the Launch Panel. You can bypass the Launch Panel by running the game from the Start Menu.</FONT><FONT color="#080000" size="3">  <FONT size="3">Click on the <B> START</B> button, choose<I> Programs</I> from the pop-up menu, select the <I>Deus Ex</I> folder and click on <I>Play Deus Ex </I>from the  ensuing pop-up menu.<br>
 <br>
 <B>NOTE: </B>You will need the game CD in your CD-ROM drive at all times while playing <I>Deus Ex</I>.<br>
 <br>
 <hr>




 <FONT color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><B><a name="prepare">Prepare your Hard Drive</a><br></font>
 </B>
To ensure that your installation is trouble free, you should check to see that both your hard drive and file system are tuned for  optimum performance. Windows 95/98 comes with two utility programs that find and fix any errors and optimize your hard  drive's performance.<br>
 <br>
 The first of these programs is called <B>ScanDisk</B>. ScanDisk checks your hard drive for problems and fixes any that it finds. To  run ScanDisk, click on the <B>START</B> button from the Windows 95/98 Taskbar, followed by <B>Programs</B>, then <B>Accessories</B>,  then <B>System Tools</B> and, finally, <B>ScanDisk</B>.<br>
 <br>
 Once ScanDisk has finished running, you should optimize your hard drive's performance by running a program called <B>Disk  Defragmenter</B>. You can run Disk Defragmenter by clicking on the <B>START</B> button from the Windows 95/98 desktop,  followed by <B>Programs</B>, then <B>Accessories</B>, then <B>System Tools</B> and, finally, <B>Disk</B> <B>Defragmenter</B>.<br>
 <br>
 You can also run ScanDisk and Disk Defragmenter by opening My Computer, right-clicking on the drive you want to optimize and choosing &quot;Properties.&quot; Once the Properties window appears, click on the Tools tab and select either Check Now or  Defragment Now. You will probably want to run each of these programs, in turn.<br>
 <br>
<hr>




 <FONT color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><B><a name="uninstall">Uninstall Deus Ex</a><br>
 </B></FONT>
 If you need to uninstall <I>Deus Ex</I>, you may do any of the following three things:<br>
 <br>
 Insert the <I>Deus Ex </I>CD into the CD-ROM drive to activate the AutoPlay feature, which will bring up the Launch Panel. Click  on the <B>Uninstall</B> button.<br>
 <br>
 Or:<br>
 <br>
 Click on the <B>START</B> button, choose<I> Programs</I> from the pop-up menu, select the <I>Deus Ex</I> folder, and click on <I>Uninstall  Deus Ex </I>from the ensuing pop-up menu.<br>
 <br>
 Or:<br>
<br>
Go to the <B>CONTROL PANEL </B>and choose <FONT size="3"><B>ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS</B>. Click on <I>Deus Ex </I>from the pop-up panel that  appears and select the <B>Add/Remove</B> button.<br>
 <br>
 <hr>




 <FONT color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><B><a name="directx">DirectX 7.0a</a><br></font></B>

To run <I>Deus Ex</I> you must have <B>DirectX 7.0a</B> installed. You also need DirectX 7.0a compliant drivers for your video card  and sound card.  Please note that although DirectX 7.0a can be installed with the game, <B>your video and sound card drivers may also need to be updated</B>.We strongly recommend that you regularly update your video card drivers to the latest  drivers available.  If you have any video problems at all while running <I>Deus Ex</I>, please update your video drivers and read  through the rest of this file before contacting our technical support department.<br>
 <br>
 During the video driver selection after you select D3D there is a link that takes you to the <I>Deus Ex</I> Direct 3D support page at <a href="http://www.deusex.com/direct3d.htm" target="_blank">www.deusex.com/direct3d.htm</a>.<br>
 <br>
 In the &quot;<I>Deus Ex</I> Web Sites&quot; section found later in this document, we have listed the most common video and sound card  manufacturers' web sites, so you will be able to find the latest drivers available for your hardware.<br>

 </FONT><FONT color="#000000"  face="Arial"><B>Matrox G200<br></B></FONT>
Running the game in 32-bit color mode is not recommended with this chipset.<br>
<br>

<FONT  face="Arial"><B>3Dfx Voodoo 1<br></B></FONT>
This chip only supports 640x480 in 16-bit color.  We recommend that you set all detail settings to low.<br>
<br>

 <FONT  face="Arial"><B>3Dfx Voodoo 2<br></B></FONT>
The Voodoo 2 only supports 640x480 and 800x600 resolutions, in 16-bit color.  You will be able to run <I>Deus Ex</I> at  1024x768 with 2 Voodoo 2 cards in SLI mode.<br>
<br>

<FONT color="#000000" face="Arial"><B>Intel 810<br></B></FONT>
Running the game in 32-bit color is not recommended.<br>
<br>

 <FONT color="#000000" face="Arial"><B>Savage 4, Diamond S540<br></B></FONT>
Setting the UI/Menu Background to <I>Snapshot</I> will result in some graphic corruption, we recommend that you use the Render  3D or Black setting.<br>
<br>

 <FONT color="#000000" face="Arial"><B>Direct3D cards<br></B></FONT>
On some of the cards that support Direct3D, there are minor sorting issues on signs, computer terminals and objects seen at  long range.  If you switch the Texture Color Depth setting (found under Display, in Game Options) to 32-bit color, the sorting issues will disappear. As an alternative, some cards can be forced to use a 24-bit or 32-bit z-buffer from the Windows  control panel display settings. Consult your video card documentation for details on this alternate procedure.<br>
 <br>
 <hr>

 <FONT color="#0000FF"  face="Arial"><B><a name="display"></a>Display Settings<br></B></FONT>
 <I>Deus Ex</I> allows you to change a large number of graphic options in order to achieve the best performance while running on  your hardware.  If the game is running slowly on your system, there are a number of Game and Display options you can  change to help optimize the performance of the game. The Display settings can be found by selecting Game Options, and  clicking on Display.  <br>
 <br>
 The settings listed below will make the biggest difference in performance, especially World Texture Detail, Screen Resolution  and Texture Color Depth.  For a list of all of the Game Options and Display Settings available, please consult the game  manual.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Adjust Brightness</B> &#150; If you find the game to be a little too dark or too bright, you can change the overall brightness by  selecting this option and moving the slider.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Toggle Full-Screen Mode</B> &#150; You can toggle between a window and full screen with this setting.  We recommend that you  run <I>Deus Ex</I> in full screen mode at all times. (It looks a lot better that way.)<br>
 <br>
 <B>Rendering Device</B> &#150; You can change the 3D graphics mode by selecting this option.  The game will exit and restart, bringing up the Video Configuration screen (see the Video Configuration section in this document).  Make sure you save your game  before changing your rendering device, or you will lose your current progress.  The only modes that are officially supported  are <B>3Dfx Glide for Windows, </B>and <B>Direct3D Support</B>.  If you are running in any other mode<B>, we highly recommend that  you switch to one of the supported modes.<br>
 </B><br>
 <B>Screen Resolution</B> &#150; If you lower the screen resolution within the game, you will probably get a better frame rate.  If the  game is running slowly on your system, try lowering the screen resolution for better results.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Texture Color Depth</B> &#150; The game will run fastest in 16-bit color mode. Not all 3D cards support 32-bit color. In order for  a Texture Color Depth change to take effect, quit out of the game to the desktop and restart the game.<br>
 <br>
 <B>NOTE:</B> You can't change Texture Color Depth and screen resolution at the same time. Set screen resolution first, click Okay  and then return to the Display Settings screen to change texture color depth.<br>
 <br>
 <B>World Texture Detail/Object Texture Detail</B> &#150; Setting the Detail Levels to LOW will help increase performance on some  cards. However, textures will appear blurry.<br>
 <br>
 <hr>




 <FONT color="#0000FF"  face="Arial"><B><a name="sound"></a>Sound Settings<br></B></FONT>
 <B>Effects Channels</B> &#150; If you reduce the number of effects channels, you may get an increase in performance.<br>
 <br>
 <I>Deus Ex</I> offers some advanced options that are supported by the latest and greatest sound cards:<br>
 <br>
 <B>Dolby Surround Sound </B>&#150; To turn on the Dolby Surround Sound setting, you must have a stereo sound card and your  computer must be hooked up to a Dolby Pro Logic Surround Sound-capable receiver. <br>
 <br>
 <B>Hardware 3D Support  - </B>If your sound card supports 3D and environmental sound (such as EAX and A3D compatible  sound cards), you can enable Hardware 3D Support for a highly immersive experience.  However, if your card does not  support hardware acceleration, 3D and environmental sound, you may not get any sound at all with Hardware 3D Support  turned on.  If this happens, just go back to the Audio Options and turn Hardware 3D Support <B>off</B>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>NOTE:</B>  If you change this option, you will need to exit the game back to the desktop and restart for these changes to take  effect.<br>
 <br>
If you are experiencing sound problems such as sound skipping or stuttering, please update your sound card drivers.  Also, if you are running the game with a small install, reinstall the game with all of the game components selected.<br>
<br>
For information about all of the Audio Settings, refer to your game manual.<br>

 <FONT face="Arial" color="#0000FF" ><B><a name="tips"></a>Additional Performance Tips<br>
 </B></FONT>
 While <I>Deus Ex</I> will run fine with 64 MB of RAM, your playing experience will be smoother if you have at least 128 MB of  RAM. Regardless of how much memory you have, you can maximize your available memory and increase the overall  performance of the game engine by doing the following:<br>
 <br>
 
<UL><LI>Closing any open windows<br>
 <LI>Shutting down all other programs, including menu-bar programs like ICQ<br>
 <LI>Defragmenting your hard drive<br>
 <LI>Making sure you have additional free space on your hard drive.<br>
 <br>
 </UL><P>
The game will run more smoothly if you do the <B>full install</B> by installing all of the available game components when you install  the game.  If you wish to change the install type after you have already installed, just uninstall <I>Deus Ex</I> and install the game  again (make sure you have enough room on your hard drive).  Your saved games will not be deleted.<br>
 <Br>
 <hr>




 <FONT color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><B><a name="gameplay"></a>Gameplay Features and Tips<br>
 </B></FONT><B>Save/Load Game<br>
 </B>During the game, you will move through map transitions, leaving one map and entering another.  At these map transitions the  screen displays the word <B>SAVING </B>followed by the word <B>LOADING</B> before the game continues to the next map.  The game automatically saves the <I>state</I> of the previous map, but it DOES NOT automatically save your <I>game</I>.  You will need to  manually save your game through the game menu or by using the Quick Save hot key.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Climbing Ladders<br>
 </B>When mounting a ladder from the top, or climbing off a ladder onto a ledge, it helps if you hold the crouch button.  Having  your character crouch while attempting to mount a ladder from the top (going down) also decreases the chances of &quot;falling&quot; off the top of the ladder.  Holding the crouch button down while moving up and off a ladder onto a ledge makes it easier to move onto the ledge.<br>
 <br>
 When climbing up and down a ladder, you are allowed some forward and sideways movement but be careful not to fall off  the side or front of the ladder.  You can prevent yourself from falling off by always looking towards the ladder and keeping  yourself centered on it.  This is especially true while moving down a ladder &#150; if you look away from the ladder while moving  down you may move forward and fall off if you aren't careful.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Crosshairs<br>
 </B>As you move through the world, the crosshairs at the center of the screen will change color depending on the nature of the  person or thing you position it over:<br>
 <br>
 If the crosshairs are <FONT color="#008000"><B>green</B></FONT>, you have a friendly or neutral person or animal targeted.<br>
 If the crosshairs are <FONT color="#FF0000"><B>red</B></FONT>, you are targeting an enemy.<br>
 If the crosshairs are <FONT color="#FFFFFF"><B>white</b></font>, you have an object targeted.<br>
 <br>
 Pay close attention to the crosshairs color, some characters who look like enemies may actually be friendly.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Turrets and Security Systems<br>
 </B>If you successfully log into or hack a security system, a security system screen is displayed.  This screen allows you to change  the state of cameras, doors, locks and, at higher skill levels, turrets:<br>
 <br>
 If the turret is set to <B>allies</B>, the turret will attack you and your allies.  <br>
 If the turret is set to <B>enemies</B>, the turret will only attack your enemies.  <br>
 If the turret is set to <B>everything</B>, the turret will attack everyone and everything in the area.<br>
 Set the turret to <B>disabled</B>, to completely disable the turret.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Enemy Arm Injuries<br>
 </B>Arm injuries can make the enemy drop their weapons.  To do this, shoot the enemy in the arm repeatedly until their weapon  falls to the ground.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Skill Levels<br>
 </B>Do not take your skill levels lightly, they make a huge difference in the way your Deus Ex game plays out.<br>
 <br>
 Remember to upgrade your skill levels throughout the game as you obtain skill points.  <br>
 <br>
 The non-weapon based skills are just as powerful or even more powerful compared to your weapon skills.<br>
 <br>
 If you frequently run out of lockpicks or multitools, you may want to consider upgrading your lockpicking and electronics skill  levels to &quot;Trained&quot; or higher.<br>
 <br>
 If you want to hack computers, ATM's and security systems, your computer skill will need to be set at &quot;Trained&quot; or higher.<br>
 <br>
 <B>NOTE:</B> You won't be able to train up to master level in every skill so be careful how you allocate your skill points. Once  they're spent, you can't get them back.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Augmentations<br>
 </B>Augmentations are special abilities that you can turn on and off at will.  The augmentation canisters needed to install  augmentations and the upgrade canisters to increase their effectiveness are usually well-hidden.  These canisters are very  valuable so you may want to take the extra time to search for them or spend the resources required to reach them.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Combat vs. Stealth<br>
 </B>Using combat to complete mission objectives is often an option but it isn't always the <I>best</I> option.  You should also attempt to use stealth and cunning to outsmart your opponents.  Try to keep silent and stay out of sight of enemies and cameras, and use your surroundings to your advantage.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Stuck?<br>
 </B>Explore the entire area, talk to the people in the area, look around for ventilation shafts in the floors and walls, hidden ladders, doorways and keypads. There is almost always another route to get to where you want to go.<br>

 </B></FONT><B>CD-ROM  -  </B><I>Deus Ex </I>requires at least a 4X CD-ROM drive with 32-bit <I>Windows 95/98</I> drivers.<br>
 <br>
 <B>I receive a &quot;xxxxxx.xxx not found&quot; error message when installing or running </B><B><I>Deus Ex</I></B><B>.<br>
 </B><br>
 This error message is usually the result of your computer using MS-DOS (16-bit) drivers instead of Windows 95 (32-bit)  drivers for your CD-ROM drive. You can easily check to see if this is causing problems by opening the <B>CONTROL  PANEL </B>(either click on the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon or click on the <B>START</B> button followed by &quot;Settings,&quot; then &quot;Control  Panel&quot;). In the Control Panel window, double-click on the &quot;System&quot; icon then click on the &quot;Performance&quot; tab. You should now see a summary of the performance status of your computer. One of the lines should say &quot;<B>File System: 32-bit</B>&quot; and the last  line should say &quot;<B>Your system is configured for optimal performance</B>.&quot; If you see a message saying &quot;<B>Drive X is using  MS-DOS compatibility mode</B>,&quot; then you will need to contact your system vendor to obtain and install 32-bit drivers for your CD-ROM drive.<br>

 </B>Chances are your video card drivers are not compatible with DirectX. The only solution is to get DirectX 7 compatible drivers from your video card manufacturer.<br>

 <B>The Installer keeps stopping when a certain percentage is complete, so I can't install </B><B><I>Deus Ex</I></B><B>.<br>
 </B><br>
 There are three likely causes:<br>
 <FONT color="#080000"><B>1)</B>	You may have run out of free space on your hard drive. Please remove unwanted programs to free up additional space  for the game, and then reinstall <I>Deus Ex. </I>You'll need at least 150 MB free to install the game.<br>
 <B>2)</B>	It's possible that files are being copied to a corrupted area of your hard drive. If this is so, you'll need to run the <B> ScanDisk </B>program and make sure to use the <B>Thorough </B>option. After ScanDisk has finished running and has informed you  that your drive is free of errors, try to re-install.<br>
 <B>3)</B>	The last major cause is dirt or fingerprints on the CD-ROM disc itself. Examine the bottom of the disc; if you see any  fingerprints or dirt, carefully clean the disc using a clean, soft, lint-free cloth by wiping from the center of the disc (near the  hole) towards the outer edge in a straight line.<br>

 <FONT size="3"><B><I>Deus Ex  </I></B><B>is crashing to the desktop with no error messages.<br>
 </B><FONT color="#080000"><br>
 </FONT><FONT color="#000000" size="3">This can be caused by several different things. Here's a list of the most common culprits associated with these crashes:<br>
 <br>
 <FONT color="#080000">1)  Make sure <B>DirectX 7</B> has been installed properly. <br>
 2)  Make sure the game has been installed properly. <br>
 3)  Make sure the CD-ROM is clean (check for both scratches and smudges on the reading surface of both CD's). <br>
 4)	Make sure you have the <B><U>latest </U></B>Windows 95/98 drivers for your video card and that they are DirectX 7 compatible. <br>
 5)	Make sure you have the <B><U>latest</U></B> Windows 95/98 drivers for your sound card and that they are DirectX 7 compatible. <br>
 6)	Make sure <B>Virtual Memory</B> is enabled on your system. <br>
 7)	Run <B>ScanDisk</B>. <br>
 8)	Run <B>Disk Defragmenter</B>. <br>
 9)	Make sure you do not have any Anti-Virus utilities running (like <I>Norton's AntiVirus</I>) while installing or playing <I>Deus Ex</I>.<br>
 10)	Make sure you do not have any 3rd party Windows 95/98 memory management utilities (like <I>QuarterDeck'</I>s <I>QEMM  8.0</I> <I>for Windows 95</I>) running resident prior to playing <I>Deus Ex</I>.<br>
 11) Do not overclock your system, the results are unpredictable.<br>
 12)	Make sure you do not have any 3rd party Windows 95/98 disk caching utilities running resident prior to playing<I> Deus  Ex</I>. <br>
 13)	Make sure you do not have <I>Norton's Crash Protector</I> running resident prior to playing <I>Deus Ex</I>. <br>
 14)	Try uninstalling and then reinstalling the game. <br>
 15)	Try exiting the game, rebooting your machine, and re-entering the game.<br>
 </FONT><br>
 Note that if your system crashes to the desktop while playing <I>Deus Ex, </I>you should probably reboot your computer before  starting a new play session.  Otherwise, DirectDraw or DirectSound may be in a locked state, and the game will be unable to  use your sound or video hardware.<br>
 <FONT size="1"><I><br>
 </I></FONT><FONT size="3"><B><br>
 Why doesn't the AutoPlay feature come up when I insert the </B><B><I>Deus Ex </I></B><B>CD into the CD-ROM drive?<br>
 </B><br>
 This is usually a configuration issue. There are many different ways to enable the AutoPlay functions of Windows 95/98. The  standard method is described below: <br>
 <FONT color="#080000"><br>
 1)	Enter the Windows 95/98 <B>CONTROL PANEL </B>from the desktop by clicking on the <B>START </B>button, followed by<FONT size="3"><B>  SETTINGS</B></FONT><FONT size="3">, and then <B>CONTROL PANEL</B>.<br>
 2)	Double-click the icon labeled <B>SYSTEM</B>, usually located alphabetically towards the bottom of the <I>Control Panel</I> window, to bring up the <B>System Properties </B>panel.<br>
 3)	Click on the tab at the top labeled <B>Device Manager</B> and when the new panel appears, locate the section labeled <B> CD-ROM</B> and click the <B>PLUS (+)</B> sign in front of it. (If there is a minus sign in front, don't click it.) <br>
 4)	Now double-click the CD-ROM drive revealed and the <B>CD-ROM Properties</B> panel will appear.<br>
 5)	Click on the <B>Settings</B> tab at the top. <br>
 6)	Towards the middle of the panel, you should see a few checkboxes within the <B>Options </B>section. At the bottom of that  section, you should see a checkbox labeled <B>Auto insert notification</B>. <br>
 7)	Make sure there is a check mark in the box provided and click on the <B>OK</B> button to complete the process. <br>
