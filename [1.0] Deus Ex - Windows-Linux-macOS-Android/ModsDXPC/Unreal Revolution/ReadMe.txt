Deus Ex Unreal Revolution
=========================


INTRODUCTION:

Deus Ex Unreal Revolution is a mod for the original Deus Ex that acts as a parody of Deus Ex: Human Revolution while providing commentary on the video game industry and modern gameplay mechanics. Assume the role of a wrist blade equipped JC Denton and perform cinematic takedowns on your mission to rescue Tracer Tong.


REQUIREMENTS:

- Deus Ex patched to v1112fm or the Steam version

- One of these custom renderers:
    - Kentie's Direct3D 10 renderer (http://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv)
    - Chris Dohnal's OpenGL renderer (http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr)

For Kentie's Direct3D 10 renderer, make sure to set ClassicLighting=True under [D3D10Drv.D3D10RenderDevice] in your DeusEx.ini to avoid lighting issues.


INSTALLATION:

1. Extract the Zip file to your Deus Ex directory. For example: "C:\DeusEx"
   or "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\deus ex" for the Steam version.

2. Start the game and press "T". Use backspace to clear the "Say" text.

3. Type "open RescueTong" without quotes and press enter.

Note: Saving has been disabled for now, but the level is fairly short and not overly challenging.


PROTIPS:

- The augmented reality goggles can be toggled on/off by selecting them and pressing "Fire"
- You can perform a lethal takedown on unalert enemies by pressing "Use" when close to them
- Iron sights on the assault rifle can be activated by pressing the "Toggle Scope" key
- Health will automatically regenerate after a brief delay
