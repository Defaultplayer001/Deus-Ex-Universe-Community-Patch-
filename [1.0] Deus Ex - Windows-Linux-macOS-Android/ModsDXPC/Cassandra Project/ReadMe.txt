The Cassandra Project: Episode 1

The opening installment of episodic Deus Ex Mod "The Cassandra Project". Requires a full installation of Deus Ex with the latest Multiplayer patch.

You are Charlotte Williams, a lower-middle-class English woman turned international Mercenary. With thirty inching ever closer, she becomes disillusioned with her work and is approached by one Nicholas Beckett. He offers her a new job: field agent for a mysterious organisation known as "The Cassandra Project".

She accepts. After all, what has she to lose?

Over the next few months, her body is modified with technology beyond her experience or knowledge, boosting her considerable natural abilities to posthuman levels. Today, she leaves her London apartment for the last time, and travels to Birmingham for her first day at her new work.

Problem: She doesn't actually know where the base is. Her orders are to meet up with a man called "Johnny Casino" in a bar called "Secrets and Regrets", who will give her the location of the HQ.

She is, to say the least, more than a little anxious.

That's all for now. Everything else is explained in game. Relax.
