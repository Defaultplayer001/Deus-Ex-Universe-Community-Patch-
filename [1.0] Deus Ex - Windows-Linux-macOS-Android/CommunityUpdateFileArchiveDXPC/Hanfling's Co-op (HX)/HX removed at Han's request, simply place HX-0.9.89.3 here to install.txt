He's mentioned he has his own unique plans for an installer. He was vague, but it sounds interesting! 

If you want to use the CU to install it, simply place the HX archive in the same folder in this text file.

Currently intended for HX-0.9.89.3, but other versions *may* work if renamed to "HX-0.9.89.3.zip"
