### Controller support:
A program (Antimicro) is included that will run automatically when you launch the shortcut. This will let you use any gamepad capable of using the Xbox 360 driver in the game.

Key-binds and guide can be found in the Help folder. (To-do) 

Note that you will have to exit the program manually from the icon tray if you want to stop the controller registering as mouse&keyboard input.
