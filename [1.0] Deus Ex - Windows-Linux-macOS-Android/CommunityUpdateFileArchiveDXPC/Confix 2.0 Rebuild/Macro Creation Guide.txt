I personally use Pulover's Macro Creator, a copy is included. Can export to / is based off of AutoHotKey. 

I turned off mouse movement recording by going to Options-Settings-Recordings then un-checking "Mouse Moves".

ConEdit doesn't use mouse movementes anyways, so this saves a lotta of scripting and space.

Many WinActivate instances need to be modified to remove title that includes the specific path for the file your using.
This breaks the macro if you open *any* other file.
Just remove the path from the title, this can be done in a text editor and mass replaced.
For example:

"ConEdit - C:\Deus-Ex-Universe-Community-Update-\[1.0] Deus Ex - Windows-Linux-macOS-Android\CommunityUpdateFileArchiveDXPC\Confix 2.0 Rebuild\Scripts\Mission1.con ahk_class ThunderRT6FormDC"
becomes
ConEdit ahk_class ThunderRT6FormDC
Just "Conedit" seems to work as well.
However not sure currently what the suffix does, so keeping it for now as it doesn't seem to hurt.
Try not to click the top bar, there seems to be a bug that causes it to be replayed as a double click and minimize it, potentially and usually messing up the rest of the macro.
Mouse clicks are sometimes needed to activate a window, however they aren't actually needed in the script.
Each time you activate a window a "Winactivate" command is recorded that will bring up the window itself.
Mouse clicks can be safely deleted if only used to activate a window. In fact from my experience so far I'd recommend it.
Minimizing mouse movement seems to make a script more reliable.
