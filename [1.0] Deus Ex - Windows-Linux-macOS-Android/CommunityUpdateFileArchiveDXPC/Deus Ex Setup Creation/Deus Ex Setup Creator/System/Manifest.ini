This page intentionally left blank. (Because I accidently wrote the script using type commands in manifestmerge.bat that expect a manifest.ini and doesn't create one if not present, thus failing. Should properly fix but this was way easier then what should be an actual easy fix. Will do...eventually. ToDo.png)
