FULL IS FOR EDITING

Lite does not work 

Full has all the needed .u files, except conversation files. (If needed get those from Confix.) 

Included at Han's suggestion, supposed to cause int errors. Most noticeably duplicate render int entries, causing duplicate renderers to show up on the selection screen.

However, I (DP), discovered that if you don't have redundant paths in DeusEx.ini, or simply don't have a DeusEx.ini - 

Then your modtitle.ini can have whatever paths it needs, without having duplicate int. 

If it does cause errors, their also arguably minor enough to be worth the space savings. 

Though, also arguably not considering modern storage.

Still, the choice is there.
