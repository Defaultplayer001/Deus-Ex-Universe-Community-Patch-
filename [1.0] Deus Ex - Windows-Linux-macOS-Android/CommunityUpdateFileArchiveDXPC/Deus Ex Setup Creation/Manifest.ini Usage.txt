Error messages appear in XP! Very useful for debugging 

IMPORTANT NOTE: BE CAREFUL OF SPACES AND SYNTAX IN GENERAL
If you have a space, say; right at the inital [Setup] line, so it's as follows:
[Setup] 
vs
[Setup]
Highlight to see the one space after the first example. 
This will BREAK the setup with a missing version number error.
Keep MANY backups, and if in trouble, revert to your last working copy and carefully work your way back to where you were.
In my experience this is normally faster then trying to debug the black box that is this setup. 

MasterPath=
	Default value is MasterPath=..
	Unknown purpose, if not present setup seems to still fine.
	In a command prompt, one period "." refers to the current directory, two ".." refers to the parent directory.
	My initial guess was this would specify the main working directory. 
	However changing the valuse seems to have no effect
File=
	Install command 
		Example: File=(Src=System\SystemFiles.exe,Size=54847488)
	Will add a file from the specified location(in this case SystemFiles.exe) and move it to the specified insall directory
	If the file is not in the specified location, the launcher *will* crash
	Size tag is used to display space needed during install.
	Not including it does not effect operation, nor does having the wrong size listed.
	Use quotes if the target file or location has spaces
		Example:File=(Src="Help\Mulitplayer\Co-Op (HX)\ReadMe Co-Op (HX).txt",Size=106)
Language=
	Specifies which language files to use for install.
		Example: Language=FRT installs French with French language files. 
	Note: This ONLY specifies which language files to use DURING install.
	You also *need* Core.int, Manifest.int, Setup.int and Windows.int for your specified language, or it will crash.
	They don't have to be unique, you can just copy the default English .int files and rename with your languages ID code. Though customization/translation is obviously preffered
		For example: Core.int would be rename to Core.frt
	To actually install the language files you will have to both copy the specific langauge files you want over, then set them to be used.
		For example: 
		File=(Src=System\SystemFiles%Language%.exe)
		Ini=System\Default.ini,Engine.Engine.Language=%Language%
		Ini=System\DeusEx.ini,Engine.Engine.Language=%Language%

	If you put this into a group it will copy over a self extracting exe with the specified languages ID code, the set that code to be used in the ini.
	From there just install with a postexect group.

	There is also this bit of code in some official manifests:
	[IntGroup]
	;File=(Master=SystemLocalized\*.frt,Src=System\*.frt,Lang=frt)

	Commented out and unused, but it should work. Haven't experimented with it however due to the clutter multiple sets of INT files in one folder involves.
	
%Language%
	Language variable, inputs the currently selected language's reference code as a string. 
	Example: License=License.%Language% will load license.int by default, if German is selected, License.det will be loaded!
	Note that this variable will work *anywhere*
		Example: File=(Src=System\DeusExConText.%Language%_u), will install DeusExConText.det_u if German is selected! 

	Default language selected can be changed by editing Language=int in the Setup group (the first one!) 

PostExec=
	**NOTE: ONLY SEEMS TO WORK IF THE EXE IS NAMED SYSTEMFILES.EXE, SYSTEMFILE%LANGUAGE% ALSO WORKS. Not sure why, swore I've used custom filenames before but can't reproduce reliably**

	Sets executable to run after installation.
	Only had success with exes so far.
	Example: PostExec=InstallSystemFiles will load info from an [InstallSystemFiles] group, which look as follows: 
	[InstallSystemFiles]
	ExecName=SystemFiles.exe
	WorkDir=System
	ShowWindow=False
	DeleteExec=True
	PollMessage=Uncompressing
		ExecName= Name of the executable. 
		WorkDir= Location of the executable. 
		ShowWindow= Whether or not to show the window (speculative, not tested fully) 
		DeleteExec= If true, deletes the executable after install
		PollMessage= Message to display when running (Note: probably requires custom int entry for translations, investigate)
..
	NOTE: You *must* have installed the exectuable with the File= command! Or it will attempt to launch a file that's not there!
	It will fail to launch without an error, and setup will finish as though normal. 
		Example: File=(Src=System\SystemFiles.exe,Size=54906880) is how the SystemFiles.exe is installed. 
	*You also need have transferred the setup files to the desired install directory, or it will fail to launch.*
	There seems to be a way to install an EXE without PostExec, some sort of hardcoding in the exe, as I have seen a few disc based manifests without the postexec that still install a systemfiles.exe
	Also, you can only specify ONE exec per group, to install more, just create EXE specific groups.
	Use "WorkDir=." to run an exe in the root directory 

Lang=
	installs files if a specific lang is selected
		Example: File=(Master=SystemLocalized\*.frt,Src=System\*.frt,Lang=frt) will install ALL frt files if French is selected as the install language
	Note:Have had unreliable results using his, research further. Doesn't seem to work in a postexec group?
	On testing, it at least works properly for regular file= usage.
Size=
	Declares the size of file, used for disk space requirements.
	Not required but useful if tedious, seems likely it was done automatically with the official method.

!
	1000f manifest.ini has these lines in each group.
	Ini=!System\Default.ini,Engine.Engine.ContentOnCD=True
	Ini=!System\DeusEx.ini,Engine.Engine.ContentOnCD=True                                       

Ini=
	Adds ini entries or modifies existing ones.
	No current known way to delete entries, for multiple similar entries such as ServerActors= that need to be modified this can present issues, as only the first will be changed.
	Experiment with the above ! command, perhaps it has something to do with it.
