# Deus-Ex-1-Community-Update-

This is an unofficial patch package assembled by the Deus Ex community and Xen's Deus Ex Archive: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/dxarchive/

It includes every patch, alternate exe/renderer as well as every translation we know of. 

Also included are the original demo files which you apply the multiplayer patch too. 

This lets you play the full multiplayer and singleplayer up to the end of mission 2!

A program (Antimicro) is included that will run automatically when you launch the shortcut. This will let you use any gamepad capable of using the Xbox 360 driver in the game.

Keybinds and guide can be found in the Help folder.

Note that you will have to exit the program manually from the icon tray if you want to stop the controller registering as mouse&keyboard input. 

Updates to included files have been and will continue to be done. Please report any bugs! 

We have a discord here:

https://discord.gg/75UpZhy

Feel free to stop by with any bugs, questions, comments or criticisms.

Bugs can also be reported directly to our Trello:

This patch for me is the culmination of years researching the Deus Ex franchise, and a lifetime of being a fan. 

Like JC, I have a clone AKA twin. I remember falling in love with the game because of Paul, specifically the famous 'Ton raid. The way he cared and protected JC always reminds me of the way my own sibling has for me. 

It's my hope with this, others might continue to experience that for years to come. 

Love you bro.

I'll get you interested in playing this eventually!
