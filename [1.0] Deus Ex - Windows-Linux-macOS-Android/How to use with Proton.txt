The simplest solution right now seems to doing a "hard" install of the community update, then renaming DeusExCommunityUpdateINT.exe&ini (In the case of English), to DeusEx.exe&ini.
Then simply launching normally.
To do a "hard" install, you just copy the community update out of it's subdirectory in your Deus Ex folder, into the root. Overwriting when asked.
Note that this will break any of the shortcuts the installer made. Though you won't need them ofc if using Steam.
If you have any issues please let me know! If I have to I'll install Linux to help test, something I've meant to do for a while anyways.
