On the Xbox One store, the version sold is by default the base version of Human Revolution.

Alternatively if you can find a late disc based version, that *should* have the latest update.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to get the Director's Cut version digitally.

Please let us know about any other methods you might know about!
