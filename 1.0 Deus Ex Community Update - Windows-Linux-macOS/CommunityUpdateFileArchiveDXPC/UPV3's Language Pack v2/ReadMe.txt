Just copy all the files in the language folder you want to install in your Deus Ex root install. Run the self extracting EXE if you haven't. Delete the exe or keep as a backup

Then, change Language= in your DeusEx.ini to the custom filetype that language uses. 
Just check in the System folder in the language folder you want to install, run the exe and it will be the most common file there. 

For example,to install French, you would check in \UPV3's Langauge Pack v2\Francais-French\System\ for the most common filetype, which is .frt

Take those 3 letters and add them to Language= in your DeusEx.ini
Using French this would be Language=Frt


Assembled by Defaultplayer001 for Unofficial Patch v3 with all language resources in the Deus Ex Archive
