Titles are in chronological order.

Each subsequent release of a title is given a .1, and they just keep adding up. 

Every release is listed for the sake of completion, even if nothing / a barebones amount of material is available. 

To reduce title clutter & pathname sizes, only the unique portion of each subsequent title is used. 

For example, the longest title: 

Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut

turns into: 

Director's Cut


End tag is the platform the game runs on.
