Thanks RW! 

Original post they made:

Title=How to get the demo working
Post=You need to contact SecuROM support and show them a pic of the demo not loading, they will then provide you with a fixed .exe file that will make the game work on modern machines. The demo worked for me after I replaced the exe.
