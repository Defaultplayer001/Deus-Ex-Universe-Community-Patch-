Demo Version of UPV2 made by Defaultplayer001, with assistance from Han of Revision (He just told me exactly what to do, thanks Han!)

If you use this the intro will be skipped, and at the end of the second mission after talking to Jock a spash screen advertsing the game will appear.

Don't use this on a full game installation obviously! The standard user should have no reason to use this!
