Presentation:
Due to an error of archiving from Eidos/IonStorm, all Deus Ex games sold in 1.112fm version (Game of the Year, Collector, etc.) contain obsolete maps’ versions! More precisely, the maps present in the 1.110 version date back to June 2000 while those presented in the 1.112fm version date back to May 2000. By restoring the maps back to June 2000, you will be able to correct a series of bugs and important annoyances.

Bugs fixed by the patch:
-Absence of music when entering Hell’s Kitchen a third time.
-Absence of the emergency hatch in the elevator facing the Queen’s Tower (See screenshots).
-Poor lightings with low contrasts in a few maps.
-The ability to kill MJ12 soldiers with a secret gas valve in Hong Kong heliport (Buggy in the 1.112fm GotY Edition).
-Other minor bugs.

Compatibility:
For compatibility reasons with the online game, the multiplayer maps will not be replaced.

Security:
This patch was entirely written in Autolt v3, Autolt is certified by Softpedia as being free of spyware/adware/viruses. However, some rare cases of false positives can be reported, especially from Windows 10, ArcaVir and VBA32 which consider the UPX module as a potential threat. The compilation of the Autolt script goes through the use of a UPX compactor which reduces the size of the final executable. The UPX compactor is free software under the GNU General Public License.
