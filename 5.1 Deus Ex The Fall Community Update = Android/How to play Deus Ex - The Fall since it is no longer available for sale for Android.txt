1. First you need to obtain the APK and OBB files. If you message Defaultplayer proof you own The Fall on PC in the Deus Ex Community HQ Discord server, they will send you a link!

If asked by Square Enix / any one of authority we will stop doing this Immediately! 

A particular cracked 0.0.30 version has been the only one successfully installed so far, so that will be used.

Please let us know if you get any other versions working!

2. After un-archiving if needed, copy the OBB folder to your phone. Into Internal storage\Android\OBB\.

3. Copy the Apk file to your phone as well, anywhere that is convenient. 

4. After enabling Unknown sources (https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources), install the APK. 

5. That should be it! Game should be playable, please let us know about any issues!
